\title{Interpreting and technology}  
\BackBody{Since the 1970s, the notion of a lexeme, an abstract lexical unit identifying what is common to a set of words belonging to the same inflectional paradigm, has become a cornerstone of theoretical thinking on morphology and a standard tool for description. The present volume collects papers that crucially use, discuss or question the lexeme in the context of contemporary morphology, with particular emphasis on its place in the description of word formation through the concept of a \emph{Lexeme Formation Rule}. 
It will be of interest to any descriptive linguist, theoretical linguist, or psycholinguist with an interest in morphology and its interface with syntax and lexical semantics. }
